# Pet Adoption Website - Pet Shop

## Overview
This repository contains the Pet Shop component of a Pet Adoption website, designed to provide users with a seamless experience to browse and purchase pet-related products such as food, medicine, and accessories. The pet shop is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and integrates with a backend API for product management. The focus is on user-friendly product addition and management for pet supplies, supporting categories like Dog, Cat, and Bird.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Admins can add products with details such as name, description, price, category, sub-category, sizes, and images.
- **Validation**: Ensures product names contain only letters and spaces, and prices are valid numeric values.
- **Image Upload**: Supports uploading up to four product images for better visualization.
- **Bestseller Option**: Allows marking products as bestsellers for prominent display.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.
- **Toast Notifications**: Provides feedback on successful or failed operations using react-toastify.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, react-toastify
- **Backend**: Axios for API requests (assumes a backend server at `backendUrl`)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `axios` for HTTP requests
  - `react-toastify` for notifications
  - Assets for UI elements (e.g., upload area placeholder)

## Setup Instructions
To set up the Pet Shop component locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pet-adoption-website.git
   cd pet-adoption-website
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Backend URL**:
   - Create a `.env` file or update the `App.js` to include your backend URL:
     ```javascript
     export const backendUrl = "http://your-backend-url";
 â€œ

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Backend Setup**:
   - Ensure the backend API is running and supports the `/api/product/add` endpoint.
   - Pass a valid authentication `token` as a prop to the `Add` component.
